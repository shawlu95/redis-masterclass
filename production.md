## Redis in Production

### Managed Service

- using AWS or Google Cloud
- cannot use Redis modules!

### Run Redis in VM or Container

- requires lots of additonal setup, backup, security

### Redis.com - Happy Compromise

- use managed service from redis.com
- still run on aws, but redis.com is doing the setup, backup, security
